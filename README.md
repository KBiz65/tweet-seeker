## Summary

Tweet Seeker uses the Twitter API to pull information from Twitter. This was created with React for the frontend and Python/Flask for the backend.

The app is pretty self-explanatory. The splash page/homepage is just directions. There are two options you have to pull information from Twitter. The first is the "Search" option. This will allow you to enter anything into the search field and it will look for any username for that search parameter. It will also search for any tweets that include that search term. It will display up to the 10 most recent tweets from a user or the most recent 10 tweets that include the term in their content.

This app was written to become even more confortable with APIs. The Twitter API can be a bit tricky as you are required to get information from a backend server as opposed to just sending an http request. It also requires authorization which allowed me to get more familiar with sending header information with the request.d
